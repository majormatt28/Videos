# Video player 
Developing a video player utilizng youtube api.

# Summary
For this project as you may have guessed I created an app that utilizes youtube api and make it a fully functioning youtube playback app. Developing this app has been an exciting and interesting feat and I am excited to share it with others to use. If anything breaks however please elt me know and I will correct it. ^_^

# Getting Started
Well all that needs to be done is download the files to your computer. 

Using your terminal you want to flip to the appropriate directory (ie cd (specific directory). 

From there where you find the Videos folder you want to then use the command npm start.

App should show up as a local host 3000 in your browser and voila!
